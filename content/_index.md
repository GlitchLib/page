## Time to say goodbye

The journey ends here. Now we gotta move on. Keeping coding and giving people new faith.

While pandemic gives me opurtunity to thinks what I am gonna do. Now I have decide to close up this story of the **Glitch**.
Over the 2 years coding this lib and leaving that unmaintained, lonley wihout the ideas, features etc. Now I can say it, enough.
This is gives me change my plans of this lib and also [this one](https://jfrog.com/blog/into-the-sunset-bintray-jcenter-gocenter-and-chartcenter/) changes everything.

I'm gonna continue my chapter, to help maintain **Twitch4J** library. Now I have finished [new website](https://twitch4j.github.io/) for them.
I can still help them for more. I have trying to return this place. Now gonna finish my project and try migrate some projects from Bintray to Central. I have to.

In the final words. Thank you soo much to be part of the journey. See you someday after pandemic is over. We will meet again.
